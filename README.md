# netcape-bookmark-file-parser
A weekend project: Netscape Bookmark File format parser written in TypeScript.
The idea was to learn how Typescript works by doing a dummy project. It should parse this format ("should" because the documentation is not very clear): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa753582(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN (and supports some extensions I saw in my local firefox).
